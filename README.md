# Befor download

## FOR All the blueprint,I __didnt__ do the Screw holes, so thats mean you need use drill to creat a hold for screw,I use M3x25 screw to fix all the part.


# For main.

I recommend you use the 15 or 20mm Density wood board

## details

For the main button,I get 67x67mm hole,thats a really big size than the button you got.But you will get the Acrylic board,that will fix the hole.

for menu button,I get 50x50mm hole,same,that hold will a bit large than the button size,so you need the Acrylic board.

for side button,I use the 100x100mm button,thats the cheap and easy way to solve the side button problem.
